Day 1 <03.09.23>

Beggining of the project.
Feature extraction -> pitch and spectograms.
Experimenting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2 <04.09.23>

Plans: 
  make an algorithm to extract features and label notes
  make a neural network to classify notes

label notes - done
neural network - wip (left for tomorrow)
prep for training - done

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 3 <05.09.23>

neural network - finished but not working
I should preprocess the spectrograms and not just pass raw data
IDEA - process the pitch and spectrogram in separate networks and then combine them

I didnt finish. I think I will tomorrow. I should try to use sklearn for the pitch part.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 4 <06.09.23>

I used data science (numpy) to get the pitch of the notes and it worked well in most 
cases yet it sometimes struggled to get the notes with same pitch correctly (A3 and A4)

I plan to use the loudest point of spectrogram to help distinguish the octave correctly
as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 5 <07.09.23>

I found out why the with harmonic and without harmonic data gave different results and 
fixed it. I now want to identify problematic notes and try to fix them using harmonic 
data.

Problematic notes: A3 and A4; G3 and G4; D4 and D5

There are still quite some problems but I will leave that for tomorrow.
Also, tomorrow I will use the loudness spectrogram data to help distinguish the length
of the note as well as rests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 6 <08.09.23>

Rest day.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 7 <09.09.23>

Plan for today: fix remaining pitch inaccuracies.
For now those are: G3 -> C3; A3 - D3; E4 - E3; G4 -> C3; A4 - D3; 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 8 <10.09.23>

I think I know the solution for pitch stuff. I should separate the wav files and only 
then extract the features.

That part is done. Inaccuracies for now: D3 - A3; F4 - D4 - C4 - E4 - F3 - E3; D4 - D5;
F4 - C5; A4 - F4; F4 - F3; C3 - C4 - G3 - G4 - A3;

Length using spectrogram was too easy. Now I will try to do rests.

I decided to use sklearn and was amazed about the fact that the pitch predictions were
almost 100% accurate without any corrections. I feel like my data science thing was 
useless.

Now I would implement same thing for length and rests.

Length are working well.

I will leave rests for tomorrow cause I am lazy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 9 <11.09.23>

The rest model does not perform well. There could be two reasons:
1. Lack of training data.
2. Poor rest encoding and decoding implementation. 

I will start by fixing the implementation.

I think that I should make a separate model for rests specifically. But for today I will 
just remove all of the rest stuff I have made in the currecnt model and see if everything 
apart from rests works well.

As of now, the combination of the two models work perfectly. The only problem is rests.
I am very sattisfied with what I have achieved so far.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 10 <12.09.23>

Yep, I was lazy...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 11 <13.09.23>

I will try to fix the rests today or at the very least start fixing them.
First, I will prepare training data and then I would try to think of a way to label them 
properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 12 <14.09.23>

I tried to transcribe a yt video but it didnt work well. I will check everything to see 
the cause but it is likely that the problem is in the video and not in my algorithm.

The transcription service on the web actually worked quite well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 13 <15.09.23>

I have spotted a ridicolous mistake in extractData function. Now the rests seemed to 
start working a bit better yet there is a still an ammazingly big room for improvement.

That could be fixed by adding more data.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 14 <16.09.23>

I have decided to make a separate, 3rd model for rests. For now I want to perfect 
everything apart from rests and then I would start working on them as well.

I would now add more training data for model to understand quite spaces better.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 15 <17.09.23>

Rest day.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 16 <18.09.23>

Today I have been experimenting with the length detection. I found out I was stupid 
enough to make 16th and 8th mean the same to the model by converting the length to int 
and then checking if it is equal to 0,25 or 0,5. 

That ridicolous issue was fixed. Now I am trying to make the model work and I have 
finally got to making the simpler version, so the one in which I pass only the length 
of spectrogram and the col at which all values are less that -60 db.

It seemed to be working better than the one to which I pass the whole spectrogram which 
seemed really strange to me yet I am fine with that.

I removed anything related to rests from training data and it seems the simpler 
spectrogram model finally started to work properly. The 8th are decent. I would need 
to check 16th now.

Percussive part as well as averages didnt seem to work quite well so I removed them just 
after introducing them. Now I am not sure how to increase the pitch accuracy as it still 
sometimes mixes up things like A3 and A4 for instance.

THE RESTS MODEL IS VERY GOOD. I was able to get decent results.

I only see one big problem left for now that I am not sure how to solve. Let's say there 
is a quarter note and then  half rest afterwards. The spect model responsible for note 
length wouldn't be able to recognise the note since it has never seen 3/4 before.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 17 <19.09.23>

Today I didn't do much.

I have added support for dotted notes which came out quite well.

In terms of the problem related to 3/4 I believe it will be solved by adding that dotted 
support.

I have seen some problems about the rests model are still present and those could be 
fixed by adding more data.

I will probably at the very least start working on that data today.

Adding dotted data for rests didn't have a positive effect so I have removed it. I will 
start working on the flats and sharps now.

I have added sharps support. The pitch model became much better in general though it is 
still not always 100% accurate. That's what I should still work on.

The sharps also require more work.

The rests model still requires a lot of work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 18 <20.09.23>

Today I didn't do much.

I have checked all of my current problems. Here are they:
- pitch model is not always 100% accurate
- rests model sometimes puts additional rests and sometimes doesn't put them where they 
are needed.
- the spect length model also sometimes has problems. Especially with 8th and 16th as 
well as dotted notes.

I thought I could add harmonic information to help the spect long and rests models.

Harmonic only did worse so I decided not to add it.

I would like to make a test.

56 notes. 56 identified.

Pitches: 52/56 - 92.86%
Lengths: 53/56 - 94.64%
Rests: 48/56 - 85.71%

That's it for today...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 19 <21.09.23>

In order to make the rests model perform better, I could think of these:
1. Add more data. Diverse data would make it study and learn more.
2. Don't pass the raw data but rather the data that has been processed in some way. 

I have also added common.py file where I have put all the functions and variables used 
in different files to reduce redundancy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 20 <22.09.23>

Today I have worked on the common.py file and have added the imports of its functions to all of the files with models and predicts. 

That really simplified the code and improved the readability.

I have also added functionality to train several models simutaniously (although that was likely not needed).

I must continue tomorrow, I am too tired to work now...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 21 <23.09.23>

Bruh, I did nothing that day.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 22 <24.09.23>

Today, I have an amazing idea about how to improve the performance and accuracy of the 
pitch model. I thought of providing it with information about previous note so that the 
variation of the pitch caused by different previous notes would not be as significant 
problem as it was before.

Also, I have thought of better way to create the training data - by creating the files 
programmatically and not by hand. That would allow me to create diversity easily.

Now I just need to implement those two.

The pitch model was certainly improved. In current test there were only like 3 inaccuracies 
and those were type of A3 instead of A4.

The code for creating training data is ready. It will allow me to do stuff much faster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 23 <25.09.23>

Today I have used the new code to create more diverse data for the pitch model. The 
training became so slow I could play a few PUBG games and it will still not finish. Jokes 
aside I have seen that after all the model improved. 

Now I really need to focus on improving the length and rests model as those really 
destory the overall look of the sheet.

Final thought - to improve my length model I should add data with dotted notes as those are the ones 
that cause the most problems.
